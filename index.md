Welcome to my page. I am a doctoral student at the [Professorship for Management Information Systems (Prof. Schryen)](http://www.uni-regensburg.de/business-economics-and-management-information-systems/mis-schryen/), University of Regensburg.
Prior to working on my doctoral thesis, I completed a Master of Science with Honors at the University of Regensburg.

The main focus of my research is on literature reviews and design science research in information systems. My dissertation investigates how these types of research contribute to knowledge development in the information systems discipline. Summaries of both research streams and key publications can be found in the [research](research) section.

I collaborate with colleagues at the University of Regensburg and faculty members from other universities. I am advised by [Prof. Guido Schryen](http://www.uni-regensburg.de/business-economics-and-management-information-systems/mis-schryen/) and [Prof. Alexander Benlian](https://www.wi.tu-darmstadt.de/rechtsundwirtschaftswissenschaften/personenliste_rw/eine_extrabreite_spalte_10_details_12554.de.jsp), and my thesis is scheduled to be completed in July 2019. In 2018, I am visiting HEC Montréal ([Prof. Guy Paré](http://www.hec.ca/en/profs/guy.pare.html)) for a research stay.
