My research focuses on understanding and explaining how researchers use literature reviews and design science research to advance knowledge development in information systems. Regarding the knowledge creation processes leading to the original papers, my research analyzes how authors leverage tacit and explicit knowledge to create context-specific domain knowledge, abstract theoretical knowledge, or meta-knowledge that informs future research. As a cumulative effort to knowledge creation is necessary to address the big societal challenges associated with information systems, my research further analyzes how information systems research builds on literature reviews and design science research. These analyses provide a basis for deriving recommendations for the information systems community on how to foster knowledge creation.
